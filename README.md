# Covid-Death-Report
The project presents a comprehensive analysis of global deaths related to COVID-19 and NON-COVID cases which is segmented by region, time and population.  Key metrics include total deaths, breakdowns by type, and trends over months and year.
The data spans 46 countries with a combined population of 180.03 billion. Geographically, the highest concentration of deaths, both COVID and non-COVID, is observed in Europe, North America, and parts of Asia, while Africa and Australia show significantly lower death counts. Monthly trends indicate a gradual decline in non-COVID deaths, with minor fluctuations, while COVID deaths peak early in the year, decline mid-year, and rise again towards the end. Yearly data shows a sharp rise in COVID deaths in 2021 and a decline in 2022, while non-COVID deaths remain consistently higher.

### Data Sources

  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA involved exploring the data to solve some questions such as:
-  Calculationed the totals of COVID-related deaths relative to total deaths
-  Highlighted disparities in death rates by geography and population groups.
-  Geographic mapping tools were used to visualize death distributions by region and country.

  ### Insights and Reccomendations
  - The result of the analysis indicates the burden of COVID mortality was higher in North America and Europe, most likely as a result of different healthcare approaches and infrastructure, metropolitan density, or larger populations. Lower counts in Africa and other regions can be the result of fewer severe outbreaks, younger populations, or a lack of reporting. While non-COVID deaths stayed mostly constant, COVID deaths showed seasonal variations, increasing during the colder months. According to yearly patterns, COVID mortality peaked in 2021 as a result of widespread infections before to the introduction of vaccinations, and then declined in 2022 as a result of better pandemic control. The mortality statistics were dominated by non-COVID deaths, underscoring the ongoing prevalence of other illnesses and medical disorders worldwide.
  - It is important for global healthcare sysytems be improved to handle pre-existing medical conditions as well as pandemic-related issues. Through immunisation efforts and public health initiatives, seasonal COVID peaks can be reduced with improved pandemic preparedness. To better understand mortality patterns, data collecting and reporting should be enhanced, particularly in areas like Africa. The indirect effects of COVID-19, such as the interruption of healthcare services that might have contributed to a rise in non-COVID mortality, require more investigation.
